### Starter Project React-Native using Expo.

This is a react-native expo starter project. Here, I show Drawer Navigator combined with Stack Navigator.

#### Details

- Created this project using `npx create-expo-app@latest` as given in the [doc's first page](https://docs.expo.dev/), then you will get expo-router by default.

- Expo-router uses react-navigation under the hood, but I have just used expo-router directly by referring the docs, and haven't used react-navigation directly.

NOTE: In the expo documentation, there's a setup for [nesting navigators that shows an example of using Stack-Navigator with Tab-Navigator](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/nesting-navigators/). I wanted to use Drawer-Navigator with Stack-Navigator, so after some trial and error I found this setup that I show in this repo. [I have also answered a question about this on github forum here](https://github.com/expo/router/discussions/715#discussioncomment-10827158).

Reference - [Expo Router Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/).
